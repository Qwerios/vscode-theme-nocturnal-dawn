# VSCode theme: Nocturnal Dawn

This theme is a light theme but with some dark influences.
It uses a not fully bright white editing area to focus on.
The sidebar and other UI elements are kept dark for contrast.

Since version 1.0.2 there is also a gray colored sidebar for icon visibility.
It looks like we can't customise the icon color for now in VSCode themes but will try to fix the original blue version in the future.

I originally started this theme by merging the UI style from the [Slack Theme Ochin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme) and the syntax from [Light+ dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iredchuk.light-plus-dimmed).
