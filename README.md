# VSCode theme: Nocturnal Dawn

This theme is a light theme but with some dark influences.
It uses a light and a not fully bright white editing area to focus on.
The sidebar and other UI elements kept dark as a contrast.

I originally started this theme by merging the UI style from the [Slack Theme Ochin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felipe-mendes.slack-theme) and the syntax from [Light+ dimmed](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iredchuk.light-plus-dimmed).
